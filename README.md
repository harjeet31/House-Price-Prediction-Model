<p>This is a House dataset having 1460 observation and 81 different variables.
A house value is simply more than location and square footage. The person wants to knows about different features, like totalArea, Location, Neighbourhood, GarageArea, Quality of contruction.
#### Client Housebuyer: This client wants to find their next dream home with a reasonable price tag. They have their locations of interest ready. Now, they want to know if the house price matches the house value. With this study, they can understand which features (ex. Number of bathrooms, location, etc.) influence the final price of the house. If all matches, they can ensure that they are getting a fair price.
#### Client Houseseller: Think of the average house-flipper. This client wants to take advantage of the features that influence a house price the most. They typically want to buy a house at a low price and invest on the features that will give the highest return. For example, buying a house at a good location but small square footage. The client will invest on making rooms at a small cost to get a large return.
